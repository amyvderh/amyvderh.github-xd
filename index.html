        <h1>Amy in the ICT business?!</h1>
        <hr>
         <h3>Why did I choose the course ICT?</h3>
        <p>First of all, I'm pretty drawn to languages and I always thought I wanted to include it in my life either
            through my job or just as a hobby. Programming is kinda learning a language as well. Also nowadays learning
            to code can help a lot for finding a job or making your own websites when starting your own business for
            example. I also wanted to try something completely new to broaden my horizons. But having an interest in
            something doesn't especially make you good at it. So you could be thinking: Why do you think you can work in
            this industry, or rather, why should I BELIEVE you can do this kind of work?</p>
            
        <h3>For this I have a couple of reasons:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Language</li>
            <li>Mindset</li>
            <li>Genes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ever since I started high school, I have been interested in languages. Maybe because I had difficulty with my
            own language when I was young, that I just wanted to learn other languages to prove that I am capable of learning a language
            (or anything at all). It seemed like I could pass the language subjects like french and english pretty well. Just like
            those language, I will be able to figure out how the programming language works if I take my time to look at
            the pieces of this big puzzle. When I really want something, my mindset will help me accomplish my goal. 
            Even when the course gets pretty tough, my mindset will remind me why I'm doing this. Even after two courses, 
            I'm still motivated to find my passion because of my mindset. I want to be able to say that I have accomplished something
            in life that really gets me somewhere. In this case, getting a ICT degree. The reason I want to accomplish something is because 
            I want to make others and myself proud. What is also part of my motivation is that I want to prove all the people and myself
            wrong that doubted my skills and therefor my IQ, because I had a hard time in learning Dutch when I was young. The last thing
            that will help succession is my genes. My father and his father both worked in this industry and are both great employees 
            till this day.
